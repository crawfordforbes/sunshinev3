				“Very southern, hardworking, back-in-the-day Americana, not overly twangy and you don’t need to wear a cowboy hat to listen to it.”<br/>
				<span class="bold">-My Iron Fist</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				“Their predominantly bluesy style melded elements from the muddy depths of the art form with catchier almost pop melodies to create a very pleasing though edgy sound.”<br/>
				<span class="bold">-Forget The Box</span>

				“Sunshine are a different kettle of fish with their rootsy blues; what a wonderful place in which to wallow.”<br/>

				Sunshine Nights is an Americana-roots songwriting partnership between <span class="bold">Amy Priya</span> and <span class="bold">Stephen Sunshine</span>. Their songs evoke a charming union of styles, a dichotomy of the old and new, indie folk sentiment blended with old time blues, bluegrass and a tinge of traditional jazz. Their new EP, <span class="bold italic">A Brooklyn Biography</span>, is a collection of stories from their home borough. The songs are unique, written in the context of bustling New York life far removed from the Appalachian and Southern origins of the music they love. The songs of this 6 song EP raise the question: Can there be a genre called urbangrass?  
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunshine Nights was born one fine day in Manhattan's East Village when Amy sang a song and Stephen played a guitar. They quickly realized that making music together was fun and sounded pretty cool, so they started writing songs and singing together. After they moved to Bushwick, Brooklyn, Amy picked up the double bass and Stephen the lap steel. Their first gig was in August 2009 at Public Assembly in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunshine Nights draws inspiration from their Bushwick neighborhood’s vibrant and diverse artistic culture. Since they moved there in 2006, the area has shaped their songwriting and creative process. Their influences include Alberta Hunter, Dr. John, Big Bill Broozy, Lil’ Green, and Lou Reed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold italic">A Brooklyn Biography</span> is the product of a year of intimate studio sessions recorded with an immense appreciation for the analog process that brings forth a pure, honest, and raw sound to the duo's heartbroken harmonies and passionate musicianship. The tracks were laid down on 2” 8 track tape. The EP features <span class="bold">Amy</span> on vocals, upright bass and harmonica, <span class="bold">Stephen</span> on vocals, guitar, lap steel and piano, <span class="bold">Kain Naylor</span> on percussion and <span class="bold">Jeremy Kasha</span> on mandolin. The EP was recorded and mixed at the legendary Maid’s Room in New York City by <span class="bold">Jack McKeever</span> (Rufus Wainwright, Devendra Banhart). When speaking on the process Stephen noted that “Jack (McKeever) is a strange and beautiful presence to be around. His artistic process is deep and complex, and always for the art. Time stands still in the Maid's Room and all that matters is capturing the perfect moment on tape.  He's totally old school in the sense that 90% of his process is about getting the sound and performance right, no post edits and very little mixing. Most importantly, no computers.”    
			</p>
			<p>
				The EP was mastered at Salt in Brooklyn, NY by <span class="bold">Paul Gold</span> (Animal Collective, LCD Soundsystem.) All songs were written and produced by Ferrara/Santos.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunshine Nights' previous recordings include their debut CD Down and Up Blues, a musical time capsule of songs and experiences from 2009-2013. In February of 2015 they released a self-titled second record with their 7 piece horn band. The CD was recorded mostly live at Virtue and Vice Studios in Brooklyn, NY by Anthony Gallo.  Their 3rd release was a 3 song EP called 3 released April of 2016 and recorded at Doll House Studios in Savannah, GA by Peter Mavrogeorgis and Third Man Records’ 1947 Voice-o-Graph booth in Nashville, TN.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunshine Nights has toured extensively on the East Coast, Southern United States and Pacific Northwest. They have also performed in Paris, Rome, Montréal and Vancouver. They will be touring this Fall and Spring.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunshine Nights are releasing their fourth release <span class="bold italic">A Brooklyn Biography</span>, a six song EP on <span class="bold">Wake Up Records</span> on Friday, November 18, 2016. They will celebrate the release with a performance and party at The Bat Haus in Brooklyn on Thursday, November 17, 2016.
