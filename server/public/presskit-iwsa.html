			<p>
				Sunshine Nights is a New York City based Americana-roots songwriting partnership between <span class="bold">Amy Priya</span> and <span class="bold">Stephen Sunshine</span>. Their songs evoke a charming union of styles, a dichotomy of the old and new, indie folk sentiment blended with old time blues, bluegrass and a tinge of traditional jazz.
			</p>
			<p>
				“The world will holler back if we stick around,” sings Stephen Sunshine on the song <span class="bold">MTA</span>, ushering in the main theme and title on Sunshine Nights's latest full length release. They have independently produced <span class="bold italic">If We Stick Around</span> on their label, Wake Up Records. On this new record, performances are in quartet format. They enlist the talent of drummer Pitti Andrade, who has performed on two of their previous records, as well as numerous live shows. They also worked for the first time on record with banjo, organ, piano player and vocalist Kayla Radomski.
			</p>
			<p>
				In creating this record, songwriting duo Amy Priya and Stephen Sunshine took major influence from musical greats like Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Townes Van Zandt and Mississippi John Hurt, as well as classical Indian and Tibetan texts such as Patanjali Yoga Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Bardo Thodol.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stephen recalls, “We basically started writing this record in a bar on November 8th 2016. There was such a heavy feeling of sorrow across our entire city, and the world as a whole. We are both naturally empathetic people, and we took on that weight. Friendship, civil disobedience, and making this record have kept us afloat in this trying time. The world has recently been thrown into a constant state of paranoia, so much so that making a concept album about the end of the world miraculously became a source of healing.”   
			</p>
			<p>
				One highlight of <span class="bold italic">If We Stick Around</span> is <span class="bold">New Colossus</span>. The song is about falling back in love with New York City for its strong stance against the current administration on issues such as immigration and LGBTQ rights. Amy continues, “As New Yorkers we have always come together to stand with each other when it really matters, in times like 9/11 or right now, as the federal government persecutes and attempts to extinguish our beloved communities. New York City is a place that welcomes and respects every human being, and for that, it is a beautiful place to call home.”
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold italic">If We Stick Around</span> is an all analog recording made entirely in Brooklyn from performance to pressing. If you listen to the vinyl version, you are hearing something that was never made digital, a very rare thing in the modern world. This was a very important artistic choice for the band, because all the records Sunshine Nights love were made this way.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was recorded and mixed at Seaside Lounge in Brooklyn by Charles Burst (Okkervil River, AC Newman). The analog mastering and lacquer cutting was done at Salt Mastering in Brooklyn by Paul Gold (Animal Collective, LCD Soundsystem). The records were pressed by BrooklynPhono. The duo knew immediately that the only true way to make this record was in the 12 inch record format; the band's first. In addition to what can be heard via streaming or download, the vinyl record provides more offerings to tell the full story; there are poems and themed original artwork by two of New York City's most gifted and compelling visual artists, Jeff Lewis and Dane Lachiusa.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunshine Nights's previous recordings include their debut CD <span class="italic">Down and Up Blues</span>, a musical time capsule of songs and experiences from 2009- 2013. In February 2015, they released a self-titled second record with their seven piece horn band. The CD was recorded mostly live at Virtue and Vice Studios in Brooklyn, NY by Anthony Gallo. Their third release was a three song EP called <span class="italic">3</span>, released in April 2016 and recorded at Doll House Studios in Savannah, GA by Peter Mavrogeorgis and Third Man Records’s 1947 Voice-o-Graph booth in Nashville, TN. This was re- released as a limited edition 7 inch hand lathed vinyl record. Their November 2016 full length release, <span class="italic">A Brooklyn Biography</span>, was recorded and mixed at the legendary Maid’s Room in New York City by Jack McKeever (Rufus Wainwright, Devendra Banhart). It received critical acclaim for its stripped down, raw honesty. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sunshine Nights has toured extensively on the East Coast, Pacific Northwest, Southern United States and Europe. Shows in these locations are again booked for 2019. Tour details can be found on their website.
